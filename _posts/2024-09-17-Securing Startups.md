When you're building a startup, every decision counts—especially when it comes to security. Startups typically operate with lean teams, which means prioritization is key to protecting your business without spreading resources too thin. At Seguri, we’ve worked with numerous startups, and we understand the unique challenges you face. Here’s where we recommend you focus your security efforts:

## Prioritize Security with Threat Modeling

You likely won’t have the bandwidth to address every potential threat, so effective prioritization is critical. By using threat modeling techniques like **attack path mapping**, you can focus your resources on the areas that matter most—those that directly impact your business and your customers. Check out our detailed guide on [Using Attack Path Mapping to Prioritize Your Security Roadmap](https://seguri.io/blog/Prioritize-Your-Security-Roadmap-with-Threat-Modelling/) to learn how you can apply this approach to your startup.

## Invest Heavily in Application Security

In today’s tech landscape, **your customers' data is your crown jewel**. Protecting this data should be a top priority. With the rise of web apps, APIs, and cloud services, application security (AppSec) becomes a crucial investment. Whether you're handling user credentials, processing sensitive information, or managing any form of data, robust application security practices are non-negotiable.

Start by building a strong AppSec foundation, and if you're developing software, focus on early-stage secure development practices like secure code reviews, static analysis, and penetration testing. This is especially important if you're in the early phases of building a platform or product that will eventually scale. 

## Focus on OWASP Best Practices

To guide your AppSec efforts, we highly recommend leveraging the **[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)** as a starting point. These common web application vulnerabilities are often the low-hanging fruit for attackers. Addressing them early can dramatically reduce your attack surface.

And, if your startup is working with artificial intelligence (which many are these days), don’t forget to check out **[OWASP for AI](https://owasp.org/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy/)**. AI introduces new attack vectors and security concerns, and OWASP has built frameworks to address these risks.

## Don't Roll Your Own Crypto or Authentication

One of the biggest pitfalls for startups is attempting to **roll your own** security mechanisms. Whether it’s **cryptography**, **authentication**, or even **session management**, avoid building these solutions from scratch. Security frameworks and standards exist for a reason—they’ve been tried, tested, and vetted by security experts. Reinventing the wheel introduces unnecessary risk and can quickly lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.

Use well-established frameworks and libraries that have been extensively tested. This ensures that your security foundation is built on reliable and secure code, and it frees up your team to focus on delivering business value rather than recreating what already works.

## Conclusion

Securing a startup requires focus, smart investments, and a clear understanding of priorities. By investing in AppSec, focusing on industry best practices like the OWASP Top 10, and avoiding common security pitfalls like rolling your own crypto, you’ll be well on your way to building a secure foundation for your startup’s future.

Security might seem daunting, but it doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Prioritize wisely, use the tools at your disposal, and your startup will be better positioned to succeed in a secure and scalable way.
