When developing a robust security program, many organizations focus on policies, procedures, and technical controls. However, one crucial component that often gets overlooked is the Security Resource Plan. Without proper resourcing, even the most well-designed security strategy can fail to achieve its objectives. A Security Resource Plan ensures that all security domains and practices within your organization are adequately supported, whether through internal teams, outsourced providers, or a combination of both.

## The Importance of a Security Resource Plan

A Security Resource Plan is a blueprint that details how your organization will allocate the necessary resources—people, tools, and services—to effectively implement and sustain its security program. It's not just about having a budget; it's about strategically aligning resources with your security objectives to ensure that every aspect of your program is properly supported.

In smaller organizations, resources might be shared across various teams, such as IT, engineering, and facilities. Alternatively, you might rely on outsourced services like Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), Managed Detection and Response (MDR) vendors, or Value-Added Resellers (VARs) to fill gaps in your in-house capabilities. Regardless of your organization's size, a well-structured Security Resource Plan is essential for maintaining a resilient security posture.

## The Value of Resource Planning: Lessons from CMMC

The original Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 1.0 framework highlighted the importance of resource planning as a key component of security program development. Although this aspect was de-emphasized in CMMC 2.0, the exercise of developing a Security Resource Plan remains a valuable practice for organizations. It forces you to take a hard look at your available resources and make strategic decisions about how to allocate them effectively.

## Developing Your Security Resource Plan

### 1. **Assess Your Current Resources**

Start by evaluating your current resources. Identify the internal teams, tools, and services that are already contributing to your security efforts. This assessment will give you a clear picture of your existing capabilities and help you identify any gaps that need to be addressed.

### 2. **Identify Resource Needs Across Security Domains**

Next, map out the resource requirements for each security domain within your program. This includes areas like network security, endpoint security, identity and access management, incident response, and compliance. For each domain, determine the specific skills, tools, and services required to achieve your security objectives.

### 3. **Consider Outsourcing Options**

For many organizations, particularly smaller ones, outsourcing certain security functions can be a cost-effective way to access specialized expertise and technologies. Consider whether services like MSSPs, MDR providers, or VARs can help you fill gaps in your security program. Outsourcing can also provide scalability, allowing you to adapt to changing security needs without the overhead of building in-house capabilities.

### 4. **Align Resources with Your Security Strategy**

Your Security Resource Plan should align with your overall security strategy. Ensure that resources are allocated in a way that supports your strategic goals, whether that's reducing risk, achieving compliance, or enhancing threat detection and response. This alignment will help you prioritize resource allocation and ensure that critical areas of your program are adequately supported.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**

A Security Resource Plan is not a one-time effort. It should be a living document that evolves with your organization’s needs. Regularly review and update your plan to reflect changes in your security landscape, such as new threats, technologies, or business objectives. This ongoing process will help you maintain a well-resourced and effective security program.

## Conclusion

Developing a Security Resource Plan is an essential step in building and sustaining a successful security program. By thoroughly assessing your resource needs, considering outsourcing options, and aligning resources with your strategic goals, you can ensure that every aspect of your security program is properly supported. Even though resource planning may no longer be a requirement in frameworks like CMMC 2.0, it's a practice that can provide significant value to your organization.

Taking the time to develop and maintain a Security Resource Plan will help you build a resilient, adaptable security program that can effectively protect your organization from the evolving threat landscape.
